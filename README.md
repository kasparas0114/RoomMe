## Technical Details

For hackfest, we've tossed together an android application that consumes API endpoints exposed by a webservice located at http://roomme.azurewebsites.net (yes, we're live!). The android code features mostly UI and API-interfacing code. The "guts" of the service is actually located within the webservice. The fully fledged webservice was constructed using .NET's WebAPI 2.0 and Entity Framework 6. By taking advantage of their controller scaffolding feature (which is why one of first commits contains about half a million lines of code), we were able to quickly erect CRUD API endpoints with an autogenerated database once we had solidified the data model and a layer of corresponding POCO models. Of course, while we developed the application, the data model changed quite frequently. We used code-first migrations to update the database schema on both prod and local environments with the latest model/schema changes. Our webservice also includes a layer of DTO models to avoid relational-data headaches on the mobile application and to reduce data transfer latency. 

Because all business logic is abstracted into the webservice, users should be able to create their own apps on any platform given that they can make HTTP GET/POST/PUT calls and parse JSON.
